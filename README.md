# Angular MVC Crud Example
An AngularJS MVC Crud Example

Using AngularJs v1.7.8 and .Net Framework v4.7.2

Code is from:

https://code.msdn.microsoft.com/Getting-Started-CURD-1d0873c7

I have updated it to latest library versions, and configured project to use PackageReference method
of managing and restoring NuGet packages.

I wanted some simple basic AngularJS MVC example to teach myself combined .Net and Javascript debugging.

On Windows 10 (1809) and using Visual Studio 2019 and Rider EAP7  191.6733.764 the debugging
works well.

I used Visual Studio 2017 and the NuGet Package Reference Upgrader extension to do the initial conversion
